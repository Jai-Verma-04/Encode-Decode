# Encode-Decode
Simple String encoder and decoder made in Python 3


# What the program does
Takes input string from a user. Encode or decode the string (as selected by the user).
For encoding and decoding the string the user needs to provide a value at the time of doing the operation.
This value is called 'decode value' while decoding the string and 'encode value' while encoding the string..
If you encypted a string with a specific encode value, remember that value to decode the string to its initial string..

(Additionaly: Share the encoded string and encode value with your friend and they can decipher the message using this program)
